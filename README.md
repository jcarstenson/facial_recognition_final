# Face Detection With Artificial Neural Networks
## Rita Zevallos and Jacob Carstenson
## Supervisor: Lisa Meeden

This project served as our final project to my Artificial Intelligence class in Spring 2015. We used the Conx neural
network python library to facilitate creating and training our neural network. The funntion of the neural network is simple:
output 1 to indicate a face has been input or 0 to indicate no face has been input.

To read further about this project please read the project.pdf file.

To run the neural net, simply run:

python -i face-detection-net.py
