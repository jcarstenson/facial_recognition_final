Face Detection With Artificial Neural Networks
Rita Zevallos and Jacob Carstenson

The image processing has already been performed: the input file has been saved as inputs.dat and the target file is targets.dat. All preprocessing was done on macaw and can be found on /local/rzevall1jcarste1cs63

To run the neural net, simply run:

python -i face-detection-net.py
